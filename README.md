# KIPP Philly Performance Task
KIPP Philly Performance Task

## Tasks:

### PART 1: MAP Assessment Analysis

#### OVERVIEW
The Chief Academic Officer of KIPP Philly is preparing to meet with the leadership teams
of School A and School B to address student performance on the MAP assessment
following the 2014-15 school year. She is interested in examining two key questions:
1. Is it obvious that students assigned to certain teachers were more likely to meet
their “Fall-to-Fall” MAP Reading or Math goals?
2. Does poor attendance or chronic tardiness impact students’ MAP performance?
If the CAO is hoping to improve performance at School A and School B, what are the key
levers that she should focus on with the school leaders? What next steps would you take
to help her develop a strategy for improving regional performance?

##### TASK
Using the data provided from the KIPP Philly data warehouse, please create a short
PowerPoint presentation (no more than 10 slides) that gives basic descriptive data
related to MAP results, helps identify key issues related to student performance, and
suggests possible next steps for our KIPP Philly Chief Academic Officer (CAO). Please plan
to share the workbook (or other type of file) where you perform your analysis in
addition to your PowerPoint.
Given that you do not have much context and you do not have the ability to ask
questions, you are free to make any assumptions you deem necessary. Please make clear
in your final product what assumptions you have made. As with much of the data we
work with, there may be elements of this data that are incomplete or inaccurate. If you
see any data that seems inconsistent (or just wrong), you should note those
observations in your memo/presentation and describe how you accounted for them.

### PART 2: SQL Code Exercise

##### TASK
Please demonstrate your knowledge of querying databases to retrieve data. Using the
Data Dictionary below, write a SQL statement that returns the average daily attendance
rates for SY 2014-15 by school and grade level. Your returning data set should have 1 row
per school and grade level.
